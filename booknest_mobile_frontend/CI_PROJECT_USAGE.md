# CI Usage for BookNest Flutter App

This is the Flutter project root. Run Flutter commands here.

To analyze from this directory:
- ./analyze_here.sh

Common commands:
- flutter pub get
- flutter analyze
- flutter test
- flutter build apk

If CI starts from repository root, ensure it changes directory here before running Flutter commands, or call one of the root-level helper scripts:
- ./.linter.sh
- ./.init/.linter.sh
- ./run_flutter.sh
