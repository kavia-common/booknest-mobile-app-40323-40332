# Analyze From Here

This directory is the Flutter project root.

Run analyzer locally:
- flutter pub get
- flutter analyze

Run tests:
- flutter test

In CI, set working directory to:
booknest-mobile-app-40323-40332/booknest_mobile_frontend

Or invoke via repository root helper:
- bash .ci/run.sh
- or: make analyze (if CI runs from repo root)
