# CI Helper Scripts for BookNest Repository

This repository contains a nested Flutter app located at:
booknest-mobile-app-40323-40332/booknest_mobile_frontend

Use one of the following from repository root:
- bash analyze.sh
- make analyze
- bash ci_run_from_env.sh
- dart run tool_run_analyze.dart

Notes:
- Flutter SDK must be installed and on PATH.
- If you see "Could not determine project root directory for Flutter project",
  the runner likely executed Flutter commands outside of the app directory.
