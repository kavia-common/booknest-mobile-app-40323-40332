# SearchScreen Notes

Current state:
- Minimal UI with a TextField and a placeholder message.
- Intended to integrate with SearchService (lib/services/search_service.dart).
- Results should render using BookGrid and BookCard for consistency.

Recommended next steps:
1) Wire SearchService:
   - Instantiate SearchService(sample: sampleBooks) from services.dart
   - On text change, debounce and call search(query)
   - Render results via BookGrid

2) UX:
   - Show "no results" EmptyState when no matches
   - Keep the input at top with Ocean theme styles
   - Consider adding category filters similar to HomeScreen

3) Navigation:
   - Tapping a result opens /book/:id (existing BookCard behavior)

Tips:
- Run Flutter commands from the app root:
  booknest-mobile-app-40323-40332/booknest_mobile_frontend
  flutter pub get && flutter analyze
